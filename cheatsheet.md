# Cheat Sheet: Styling with Markdown

Markdown is a way to **style** text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown in your repository files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension. For more info see  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
