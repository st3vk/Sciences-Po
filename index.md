# Welcome to your project's website!

This is a place for you to present your project. You can upload images, videos, PDFs here. You can also link to any website you might have already created for your project.  


Head down to:
*   [Resources](resources) to see different media that you can host
*   [Cheat sheet](cheatsheet) to see different formatting possibilities

## How this works


This website is powered by your [Github repository](https://github.com/TheGreatTransition/group1) for which you have received an invitation to collaborate.
We suggest you to assign one member of your group to be in charge of managing this repository and thus your website. To get started this _tech representative_ of your group needs to accept the invitation to collaborate and sign up for a free account on Github.


Start by editing this page
You can use the cheatsheet page to learn how to use markdown.
You can see your website at this address: https://thegreattransition.github.io/group[group_number]/ where [group_number] is the number of your group.
For any change, it can take a while, so be patient (you may also need sometimes to empty your cache)

To create a new page:
click on create new file
enter a name and end it with a '.md' : newpage.md
if you know html, you can create your_file.html
the link to this new page will be [Link to the newpage](newpage)

You can simply change in the 'config_yml' file:
you can change the title, the description and the menu
for the menu, look at the example provided : name is the name shown on the button, pagename is the last part of the page url
You can create more by simply duplicating the existing lines
make sure to also change the names / create a new page in the root of your repository

Resources: to include a video, juts use the share / embed

Upload your own cover.jpg and logo.jpg in the "assets" folder

If you feel confortable enough, you can change the structure of the pages in '_layouts/default.html' and the design in '_sass/ 	jekyll-theme-cayman.scss'
