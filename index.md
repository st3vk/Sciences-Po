# Welcome to Fix&Learn's GitHub 🙂

We really like this plateform, but we wanted to create a more professional website for our project. 
Just take a look : [Fix&Learn's Website](https://fixandlearn.wixsite.com/fixandlearn) 

You will find evrything you need to know about it. Enjoy your visit 😉 

Best regards - The [Fix&Learn Team](https://thegreattransition.github.io/group28-9mMyhwrsoz/about) 

You can upload images, videos, PDFs here. You can also link to any website you might have already created for your project (see [Resources](resources.md)).
