# A Great Transition project

This repository is what powers your project's website at `https://thegreattransition.github.io/group[group_number]` where `[group_number]` is the number of your group.

If you are here because you have received an invitation to collaborate on this repository, then head down to **[tutorial](tutorial.md)** to get started with editing your website.

We suggest you to assign **one member** of your group to be **in charge of managing this repository and your website**. To get started your group's _tech representative_ needs to accept the invitation and sign up for a free account on Github.
